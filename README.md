# NumberConversions

# Introduction:
Developed a Single View iOS application in Swift that converts a given number
from one positional number system (Decimal/Binary/Octal/Hexadecimal) to another. For
example:
• Converting from 1000 Decimal to other positional number systems:
o 1000 Decimal = 1111101000 Binary
o 1000 Decimal = 1750 Octal
o 1000 Decimal = 3E8H Hexadecimal
• Converting from 11000111 Binary to other positional number systems:
o 11000111 Binary = 199 Decimal
o 11000111 Binary = 307 Octal
o 11000111 Binary = C7 Hexadecimal

# Description:

Here we are going to Implement a swift code which takes user input say decimal and convert the decimal value to binary, octal and hexadecimal values.
In the same way if user wants to change anynumber among these metrics, user can easly select the metric of their input, so that the given user input can be converted into other equivalent metrics after clicking convert button.

# Specifications:

To Provide a segment control from which the user can choose the source positional
number system (Decimal/Binary/Octal/Hexadecimal)
To Provide a text field to enter the Input value
To Provide a Convert button to perform the conversion
To Show the converted output value in the remaining 3 positional number systems
(for example, if the user has chosen Decimal as source number system, then show
the converted value in Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal)
To Provide a Clear button to clear (or reset) the contents of all controls on the page
Assume that the user always provides valid input, so no need to perform any data
validation in your code
